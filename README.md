# onleihe
A Tampermonkey user script for the German library e-lending site onleihe.de, where you can lend ebooks and other media.

The original site is missing some functionality and design, so I created this, admittedly heavy, script. Here's what it does:
<ul>
<li>new menu item to add books to an external list, which is stored in the local indexedDb database of the browser.</li>
<li>view this list within the Onleihe web site, get availability dates, sort, export to Excel</li>
<li>search results are presented as a single column to make it easier to search through them</li>
<li>for a better user experience the user account menu has been moved to the same row as all other menu items</li>
</ul>
If you are a member of multiple libraries, the external list will contain all you favourites across all libraries.

This script only works with the new (responsive) Onleihe sites - the old sites will be unaffected.

I wrote this script for myself as an exercise and because I wanted to have the functionality. I share it here, no strings attached, neither is any support attached :-)
